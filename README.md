Another small web application with Login and Registration pages connected to DB 

This is a more improved and complex web application which i developed during my first academic year. It contains JSP files with HTML code and communicates inside of the servlet. 

The main goal of the project is to create login and registration pages with welcome page.
  Login page checks the username and userpassword and redirects to the welcome page or registration page
  Registration page creates the user account inserting new information to the DataBase
  Welcome page contains converter which converts user input decimal number to the hexadecimal and octal number
